<b>Credit risk</b> is an investor's risk of loss arising from a borrower who does not make payments as promised. Such an event is called a default. Another term for credit risk is <b>default risk</b>.</p>
<p>

Investor losses include lost principal and interest, decreased cash flow, and increased collection costs, which arise in a number of circumstances:

 Assessing credit risk </st>


<p>

Significant resources and sophisticated programs are used to analyze and manage risk. Some companies run a credit risk department whose job is to assess the financial health of their customers, and extend credit (or not) accordingly.  They may use in house programs to advise on avoiding, reducing and transferring risk.  They also use third party provided intelligence. Companies like Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and Dun and Bradstreet provide such information for a fee.</p>
<p>

Most lenders employ their own models (credit scorecards) to rank potential and existing customers according to risk, and then apply appropriate strategies. With products such as unsecured personal loans or mortgages, lenders charge a higher price for higher risk customers and vice versa. With revolving products such as credit cards and overdrafts, risk is controlled through the setting of credit limits. Some products also require security, most commonly in the form of property.</p>
<p>

Credit scoring models also form part of the framework used by banks or lending institutions grant credit to clients. For corporate and commercial borrowers, these models generally have qualitative and quantitative sections outlining various aspects of the risk including, but not limited to, operating experience, management expertise, asset quality, and leverage and liquidity ratios, respectively. Once this information has been fully reviewed by credit officers and credit committees, the lender provides the funds subject to the terms and conditions presented within the contract (as outlined above).</p>

 Sovereign risk </st>

<p>

Sovereign risk is the risk of a government becoming unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations, or reneging on loans it guarantees.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> The existence of sovereign risk means that creditors should take a two-stage decision process when deciding to lend to a firm based in a foreign country. Firstly one should consider the sovereign risk quality of the country and then consider the firm's credit quality.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

Five macroeconomic variables that affect the probability of sovereign debt rescheduling are:
<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> </p>
<p>

 Debt service ratio</entry>

 Import ratio</entry>

 Investment ratio</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Variance of export revenue</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Domestic money supply growth</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

The probability of rescheduling is an increasing function of debt service ratio, import ratio, variance of export revenue and domestic money supply growth. Frenkel, Karmann and Scholtens also argue that the likelihood of rescheduling is a decreasing function of investment ratio due to future economic productivity gains. Saunders argues that rescheduling can become more likely if the investment ratio rises as the foreign country could become less dependent on its external creditors and so be less concerned about receiving credit from these countries/investors.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>

 Counterparty risk </st>

<p>

Counterparty risk, otherwise known as default risk, is the risk that an organization does not pay out on a bond, credit derivative, credit insurance contract, or other trade or transaction when it is supposed to.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Even organizations who think that they have hedged their bets by buying credit insurance of some sort still face the risk that the insurer will be unable to pay, either due to temporary liquidity issues or longer term systemic issues.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

Large insurers are counterparties to many transactions, and thus this is the kind of risk that prompts financial regulators to act, e.g., the bailout of insurer AIG.</p>
<p>

On the methodological side, counterparty risk can be affected by wrong way risk, namely the risk that different risk factors be correlated in the most harmful direction. Including correlation between the portfolio risk factors and the counterparty default into the methodology is not trivial, see for example Brigo and Pallavicini<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>
<p>

A good introduction can be found in a paper by Michael Pykhtin and Steven Zhu.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref></p>

 Mitigating credit risk </st>

<p>

Lenders mitigate credit risk using several methods:</p>
<p>

<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Risk-based pricing</b>: Lenders generally charge a higher interest rate to borrowers who are more likely to default, a practice called <b>risk-based pricing</b>. Lenders consider factors relating to the loan such as loan purpose, credit rating, and loan-to-value ratio and estimates the effect on yield (credit spread).</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Covenants</b>: Lenders may write stipulations on the borrower, called <b>covenants</b>, into loan agreements:</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 Periodically report its financial condition</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 Refrain from paying dividends, repurchasing shares, borrowing further, or other specific, voluntary actions that negatively affect the company's financial position</entry>
<entry level="2" type="bullet">

 Repay the loan in full, at the lender's request, in certain events such as changes in the borrower's debt-to-equity ratio or interest coverage ratio</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Credit insurance</b> and <b>credit derivatives</b>: Lenders and bond holders may hedge their credit risk by purchasing <b>credit insurance</b> or <b>credit derivatives</b>. These contracts the transfer risk from the lender to the seller (insurer) in exchange for payment. The most common credit derivative is the <b>credit default swap</b>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Tightening</b>: Lenders can reduce credit risk by reducing the amount of credit extended, either in total or to certain borrowers. For example, a distributor selling its products to a troubled retailer may attempt to lessen credit risk by reducing payment terms from <it>net 30 </it> to <it>net 15</it>.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Diversification</b>: Lenders to a small number of borrowers (or kinds of borrower) face a high degree of unsystematic credit risk, called <b>concentration risk</b>. Lenders reduce this risk by diversifying the borrower pool.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 <b>Deposit insurance</b>: Many governments establish <b>deposit insurance</b> to guarantee bank deposits of insolvent banks. Such protection discourages consumers from withdrawing money when a bank is becoming insolvent, to avoid a bank run), and encourages consumers to holding their savings in the banking system instead of in cash.</entry>
