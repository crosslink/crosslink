<b>Abdominal pain</b> (or <b>stomach ache</b>) can be one of the symptoms associated with transient disorders or serious disease. Making a definitive diagnosis of the cause of abdominal pain can be difficult, because many diseases can result in this symptom. Abdominal pain is a common problem. Most frequently the cause is benign and/or self-limited, but more serious causes may require urgent intervention.

Acute abdominal pain</st>
<p>

Acute abdomen can be defined as severe, persistent abdominal pain of sudden onset that is likely to require surgical intervention to treat its cause. The pain may frequently be associated with nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention, fever and signs of shock. One of the most common conditions associated with acute abdominal pain is acute appendicitis, a condition where mucus or fecal matter hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening.</p>

Recurrent abdominal pain in children and adolescents</st>
<p>

Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) occurs in 5–15% of children 6–19 years old. In a community-based study of middle and high school students, 13–17% had weekly abdominal pain. Using criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 14% of high school students and 6% of middle school students fit the criteria for adult IBS. As with other difficult to diagnose chronic medical problems, patients with RAP account for a very large number of office visits and medical resources in proportion to their actual numbers.  Most patients with RAP benefit from reassurance and techniques to manage anxiety and stress, which are frequently associated with episodes.</p>

Diagnostic approach</st>
<p>

When a physician assesses a patient to determine the etiology and subsequent treatment for abdominal pain the patients history of the presenting complaint and physical examination should derive a diagnosis in over 90% of cases.</p>
<p>

It is important also for a physician to remember that abdominal pain can be caused by problems outside the abdomen, especially heart attacks and pneumonias which can occasionally present as abdominal pain.</p>
<p>

Investigations that would aid diagnosis include
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Blood tests including full blood count, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, liver function tests, pregnancy test and lipase.</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Urinalysis</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Imaging including erect chest X-ray and plain films of the abdomen</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

An electrocardiograph to rule out a heart attack which can occasionally present as abdominal pain</entry>
</list>
</p>
<p>

If diagnosis remains unclear after history, examination and basic investigations as above then more advanced investigations may reveal a diagnosis.  These as such would include
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Computed Tomography of the abdomen/pelvis</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Abdominal or pelvic ultrasound</entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

Endoscopy and colonoscopy (not used for diagnosing acute pain)</entry>
