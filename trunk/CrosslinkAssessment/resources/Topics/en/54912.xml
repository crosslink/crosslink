The <b>dew point</b> is the temperature to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant barometric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point.<p>

The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. Relative humidity of 100% indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and the air is maximally saturated with water. When the dew point remains constant and temperature increases, relative humidity will decrease.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> </p>
<p>

The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog, and estimate the height of the cloud base. </p>

This graph shows the maximum percentage (by mass) of water vapor that can exist in air at sea level across a range of temperatures. The behavior of water vapor does not depend on the presence of other gases in air. The formation of dew would occur at the dew point even if the only gas present is water vapor.

At a given barometric pressure, the dew point indicates the mole fraction of water vapor in the air, or, put differently, determines the specific humidity of the air. If the temperature rises without changing this mole fraction, the dew point will remain unchanged; however, the relative humidity will go down accordingly (and water continues to condense at the same temperature). Increasing the mole fraction, i.e., making the air more humid, would bring the relative humidity back up to its initial value. In the same way, decreasing the mole fraction after a temperature drop brings the relative humidity back down to its initial level. For this reason, the same relative humidity on a day when it's 80°F, and on a day when it's 100°F will imply that a higher fraction of the air on the hotter day consists of water vapor than on the cooler day, i.e., the dew point is higher.</p>

 Varying pressure </st>
<p>

At a given temperature but <it>independent</it> of barometric pressure, the dew point indicates the absolute humidity of the air. If the temperature rises without changing the absolute humidity, the dew point will rise accordingly, and water condenses at a higher pressure. Reducing the absolute humidity will bring the dew point back down to its initial value. In the same way, increasing the absolute humidity after a temperature drop brings the dew point back up to its initial level. Considering New York and Denver, for example, this means that if the dew point and temperature in both cities are the same, then the mass of water vapor per cubic meter of air will also be the same in those cities.</p>

 Comfort range </st>
<p>

Humans tend to react with discomfort to a high dew point (i.e., greater than ), as it interferes with the body's normal process of perspiring (producing sweat) to cool down. High relative humidity (which results in a high dew point) impedes the evaporation of sweat and reduces the effectiveness of evaporative cooling. As a result the body may overheat, resulting in discomfort.</p>
<p>

Discomfort also exists when dealing with low dew points (i.e., below ). The drier air can cause skin to crack, become irritated more easily and will dry out the respiratory paths.</p>
<p>

Lower dew points, less than , correlate with lower ambient temperatures and the body requires less cooling. A lower dew point can go along with a high temperature only at extremely low relative humidity (see graph below), allowing for relative effective cooling.</p>
<p>

Those accustomed to continental climates often begin to feel uncomfortable when the dew point reaches between . Most inhabitants of these areas will consider dew points above  oppressive.</p>

 Calculating the dew point </st>

A well-known approximation used to calculate the dew point <it>Td</it> given the relative humidity <it>RH</it> and the actual temperature <it>T</it> of air is:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>
T_d = \frac {b\ \gamma(T,RH)} {a - \gamma(T,RH)}
</math>
</indent>
where
<indent level="1">

<math>
\gamma(T,RH) = \frac {a\ T} {b+T} + \ln (RH/100)
</math>
</indent>
where the temperatures are in degrees Celsius and "ln" refers to the natural logarithm. The constants are:
<indent level="1">

<it>a</it> = 17.271
</indent>
:<it>b</it> = 237.7&nbsp;°C</p>
<p>

This expression is based on the August-Roche-Magnus approximation for the saturation vapor pressure of water in air as a function of temperature.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> It is considered valid for
<indent level="1">

0&nbsp;°C  <it>T</it>  60&nbsp;°C
</indent>
:1%  <it>RH</it>  100%
<indent level="1">

0&nbsp;°C  <it>Td</it>  50&nbsp;°C
</indent>

</p>
<ss1>
<st>
 Simple approximation </st>
<p>

There is also a very simple approximation that allows conversion between the dew point, the dry bulb temperature and the relative humidity.  This approach will be accurate to within about ±1&nbsp;°C as long as the relative humidity is above 50%.</p>
<p>

The equation is:</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>
T_d = T - \frac {(100 - RH)} {5}
</math>
</indent>

or</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>
RH = 100 - 5 (T - T_d).
</math>
</indent>

This can be expressed as a simple rule of thumb:</p>
<p>

<it>For every 1&nbsp;°C difference in the dew point and dry bulb temperatures, the relative humidity decreases by 5%, starting with RH=100% when the dew point equals the dry bulb temperature.</it></p>

<p>

where in this case <it>RH</it> is in percent, and <it>T</it> and <it>Td</it> are in degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>

The derivation of this approach, a discussion of its accuracy, comparisons to other approximations, and more information on the history and applications of the dew point are given in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

In Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>

<indent level="1">

<math>
Tf_d = Tf - \frac {(100 - RH)} {2.778}
</math>
</indent>

For example, a relative humidity of 100% means dew point is the same as air temp. For 90% RH,  dew point is 3 degrees Fahrenheit lower than air temp. For every 10 percent lower, dew point drops 3&nbsp;°F.</p>
<p>

<it>TF</it>d is in degrees Fahrenheit; <it>RH</it> same as above.</p>

</indent>
:<math> RH= 100 {e \over e_s} </math>
<indent level="1">

<math>T_d={243.5 \ln(e/6.112) \over 17.67 - \ln(e/6.112)} </math>
</indent>
where:
<indent level="1">

RH is relative humidity and <math> T_d </math> is dew point in degrees Celsius</indent>
:<math>T </math> and <math>T_w </math> are the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures respectively in degrees Celsius
<indent level="1">

<math>e_s</math> is the saturated water vapor pressure, in units of millibar, at the dry-bulb temperature
</indent>
:<math>e_w</math> is the saturated water vapor pressure, in units of millibar, at the wet-bulb temperature<indent level="1">

<math>e</math> is the actual water vapor pressure, in units of millibar
</indent>
:<math>p_{sta}</math> is "station pressure" (absolute barometric pressure at the site that humidity is being calculated for) in units of millibar (which is also hPa).
