The <b>Toi invasion</b> (Japanese:  toi no nyūkō) was the invasion of northern <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/914/16914.xml">
Kyūshū</link> by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/321/166321.xml">
Jurchen</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/715/50715.xml">
pirates</link> in 1019. Toi (, <it>Doe</it>) meant barbarian in the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/756/16756.xml">
Korean language</link> at the time.<p>

Sailing in about 50 ships from direction of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/435/188435.xml">
Goryeo</link>, the Toi pirates assaulted <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/446/431446.xml">
Iki</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/992/333992.xml">
Tsushima</link> and then <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/218/10444218.xml">
Hakata Bay</link>. Using Noko Island ( noko no shima) in the bay as the base, for a week they despoiled villages and kidnapped Japanese people for use as slaves. At that time, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/362/32383362.xml">
Dazaifu</link>, the administrative center of Kyūshū. He raised soldiers and successfully drove them away.</p>
<p>

Three enemies were captured by Japanese army in Matsura, but they were identified as Koreans. They said that they had guarded the borderland but had been captured by the Toi. However, Japanese officers suspected them because there had been some Korean pirates in the former <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/217/324217.xml">
Silla</link> period. But, after Nakamine no Mochitaka's report who smuggled himself in to Goryeo, this suspicion was resolved. A few months later, the Goryeo delegate Jeong Jaryang () reported that Goryeo forces attacked the pirates off <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/626/527626.xml">
Wŏnsan</link> and rescued about 260 Japanese. The Korean government then repatriated them to Japan. There remain detailed reports by two captive women, Kura no Iwame and Tajihi no Akomi. </p>
<p>

These Jurchen pirates lived in what is today Hamgyŏngdo, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/255/21255.xml">
North Korea</link>. They frequently attacked the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula. In particular, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/058/1067058.xml">
Ulleungdo</link> was abandoned because of their massive attacks. The invasion in 1019 was one of those incidents.</p>
