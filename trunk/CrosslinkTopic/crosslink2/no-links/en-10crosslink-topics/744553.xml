<b>Tolui</b>, (Classic Mongolian: ᠲᠥᠯᠦᠢ <b>Toluy</b>, <b>Tului</b>, (), <b>Tolui Khan</b> (meaning the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/015/185015.xml">
Khan</link> Tolui)) (1192–1232) was the youngest son of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/699/17414699.xml">
Genghis Khan</link> by his chief khatun <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/477/489477.xml">
Börte</link>. His ulus, or territorial inheritance, at his father's death in 1227 was the homelands in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/271/19271.xml">
Mongolia</link>, and it was he who served as civil administrator in the time it took to confirm <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/857/739857.xml">
Ögedei</link> as second <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/383/533383.xml">
Great Khan</link> of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/146/240146.xml">
Mongol Empire</link> (1206–1368).  Before that, he had served with distinction in the campaigns against the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/023/55023.xml">
Jin Dynasty</link>, the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/495/58495.xml">
Xi Xia</link> and the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/458/582458.xml">
Khwarezmid Empire</link>, where he was instrumental in the capture and massacre at <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/067/252067.xml">
Merv</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/427/377427.xml">
Nishapur</link>. He is a direct ancestor of most of the Emperors of Mongolia and the Ilkhanids.</p>
<p>

Tolui never used the title of Khagan himself. Although, Genghis Khan and his immediate three successors never used any <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/758/9758.xml">
reigning title</link>s unlike the neighboring Chinese dynasties in the south, Tolui was awarded the title of Khagan by his son Möngke and were given <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/314/68314.xml">
temple name</link> (Chinese: 元睿宗; pinyin: Yuán Ruìzōng; Wade–Giles: Jui-Tsung) by his another son Kublai, when the latter tried to established the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/306/19606306.xml">
Yuan Dynasty</link> a few decades later.</p>

<sec>
<st>
 Early years </st>
<p>

During the rise of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/699/17414699.xml">
Genghis Khan</link>, Tolui was too small to involve in the battles. Tolui was almost killed by a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/877/56877.xml">
Tatar</link> when he was about five. He was saved by his sister Altani and two companions of Genghis.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> In 1203, His father bestowed on Tolui as wife <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/826/1554826.xml">
Sorghaghtani</link>, the niece of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/834/1671834.xml">
Ong Khan</link>. Their first son <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/605/742605.xml">
Mongke</link> was born in 1209. He was the best warrior among the sons of Genghis. He first entered combat against the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/023/55023.xml">
Jin Dynasty</link> in 1213, scaling the walls of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/202/22889202.xml">
Dexing</link> with his brother-in-law Chiqu.</p>
<p>

In 1221, Genghis Khan dispatched him to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/246/1379246.xml">
Khorasan</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/653/14653.xml">
Iran</link>. The cities in this area had revolted several times. The defenders of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/427/377427.xml">
Nishapur</link> killed Toquchar, the brother-in-law of Tolui in November 1220. Tolui's army evacuated Nishapur onto the plains. He ordered total massacres of Nishapur and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/067/252067.xml">
Merv</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>

Genghis Khan's succession</st>
<p>

When Genghis Khan was deciding who should succeed him he had trouble choosing between his 4 sons. Tolui had amazing military skills and was very successful as a general, but Genghis Khan chose <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/857/739857.xml">
Ögodei</link> because Ögodei was more capable politically. Genghis Khan felt that Tolui would be too cautious to be an effective leader. Tolui was with Genghis on his campaign against the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/495/58495.xml">
Xi Xia</link> in 1227. </p>
<p>

After Genghis Khan's death, Tolui generally supervised the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/146/240146.xml">
Mongol Empire</link> for 2 years. The Mongol nobles' moves were partly influenced by the tradition that the youngest son inherits his father's properties and partly because Tolui had the largest and most powerful army in central <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/271/19271.xml">
Mongolia</link> at the time. Tolui supported the election of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/383/533383.xml">
Khagan</link> and Ögodei was chosen as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/111/10111.xml">
Emperor</link>, fulfilling his father's wishes.</p>
<p>

Tolui campaigned with Ogedei and Mongke in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/364/923364.xml">
North China</link>, serving as both <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/652/779652.xml">
strategist</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/964/5509964.xml">
field commander</link> in 1231-32. After most of the Jin's defences breached, they returned north.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

Death and legacy</st>
<p>

According to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/682/1337682.xml">
Secret History of the Mongols</link>, Tolui sacrificed himself in order to cure Ögödei from a very severe illness during a campaign in China. The shamans had determined that the root of Ögödei's illness were China's spirits of the earth and the water, who were upset that their subjects had been driven away and their land devastated. Offering land, animals and people had only led to an aggravation of Ögödei's illness, but when they offered to sacrifice a family member, Ögödei got better immediately. Tolui volunteered and died directly after consuming a cursed drink. However, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/598/1269598.xml">
Ata Malik Juvaini</link> says he died from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/ury/30th_century.xml">
alcoholism</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></p>
<p>

Perhaps more important than him was the role his family, the Toluids, had in shaping the destinies of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/146/240146.xml">
Mongol Empire</link>.  Through his Christian wife <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/826/1554826.xml">
Sorghaghtani Beki</link>, Tolui fathered <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/605/742605.xml">
Möngke</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/760/20754760.xml">
Kublai</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/230/1489230.xml">
Ariq Boke</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/356/354356.xml">
Hulagu</link>, and thus was the progenitor the <link>
Great Khans</link>, Emperors of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/306/19606306.xml">
Yuan Dynasty</link>, and of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/300/542300.xml">
Il Khans</link>. During the civil war of the Mongol Empire, the Toluids supported the court of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/383/533383.xml">
Great Khan</link>.However, it was a rivalry from among Tolui's own sons, Kublai and Ariq Boke, that fragmented the power of the empire and set the western khanates against each other in the early 1260s.</p>
<p>

Rivalry between the Toluids and the sons of Ögedei and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/324/745324.xml">
Jochi</link> caused stagnation and infighting during the regency periods after the deaths of Ögedei and his son <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/592/742592.xml">
Güyük</link>. Mongke retroactively awarded his father the title of Khagan in 1252.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> When <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/760/20754760.xml">
Kublai Khan</link> established the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/306/19606306.xml">
Yuan Dynasty</link> in 1271, he had his father Tolui placed on the official record as Ruizong.</p>

Tolui had many concubines and wives. But the chief one was Sorghaghtani who was the mother of Tolui's 4 sons.</p>
