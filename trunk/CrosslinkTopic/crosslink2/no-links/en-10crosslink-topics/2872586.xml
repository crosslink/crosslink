She usually plays out as having an attitude toward the main character, usually a male, and often criticizing him in one way or another, but as the series progresses she eventually warms up to him or falls in love with him, though usually finds it very hard to admit it outright.</p>

<it>Tsundere</it> as a concept is not strictly limited to women, and is not strictly limited to manga or anime. The character Germany from the series <it><link xlink:label="hetalia" xlink:type="none" xlink:title=" Axis Powers"></link></it> is portrayed as being <it>tsundere</it>, and is paired with a "lovable loser", Italy.
