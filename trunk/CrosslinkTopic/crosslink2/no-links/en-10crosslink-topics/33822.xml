<b>Westwood Studios</b> was a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/399/32399.xml">
video game developer</link>, based in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/737/47737.xml">
Las Vegas, Nevada</link>. It was founded by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/841/2414841.xml">
Brett Sperry</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/701/1534701.xml">
Louis Castle</link> in 1985 as <b>Westwood Associates</b> and was renamed Westwood Studios when it merged with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/852/1027852.xml">
Virgin Interactive</link> in 1992. The company was bought from Virgin Interactive by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/933/262933.xml">
Electronic Arts</link> (EA) in 1998, and closed by EA in 2003.</p>
<p>

Westwood is best known for developing <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/251/77251.xml">
real-time strategy</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/970/26757970.xml">
adventure</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/777/356777.xml">
role-playing</link> genres. It received an entry to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/796/100796.xml">
Guinness book of records</link>, for selling more than 10&nbsp;million copies of <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/053/2053053.xml">
Command &amp; Conquer</link></it> worldwide. Electronic Arts continues to develop games based on Westwood's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/666/207666.xml">
<it>Command &amp; Conquer</it> series</link>. The last former Westwood employee quit working for Electronic Arts after the release of <it><link xlink:label="command &amp; conquer" xlink:type="none" xlink:title=" Generals"></link></it> in 2003.</p>

 History </st>
<p>

The company's first projects consisted of contract work for companies like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/813/760813.xml">
Epyx</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/893/357893.xml">
Strategic Simulations, Inc.</link> (SSI), porting <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/148/45148.xml">
8-bit</link> titles to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/304/23592304.xml">
16-bit</link> systems like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/980/1980.xml">
Commodore Amiga</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/40s/2140s.xml">
Atari ST</link>. Proceeds from contract work allowed the company to expand into designing its own games in-house. Their first original title was <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/651/3082651.xml">
Mars Saga</link></it>, a game developed for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/933/262933.xml">
Electronic Arts</link> and released in 1988. They pioneered the genre of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/251/77251.xml">
real-time strategy</link> with the release of <it><link xlink:label="battletech" xlink:type="none" xlink:title=" The Crescent Hawk's Revenge"></link></it>, one of the more literal translations of the classic tabletop game <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/330/206330.xml">
BattleTech</link>. One of the company's first great successes was <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/868/253868.xml">
Eye of the Beholder</link></it> (1990), a real-time <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/777/356777.xml">
role-playing video game</link> based on the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/940/7940.xml">
Dungeons &amp; Dragons</link> license, developed for SSI. Other publishers of early Westwood games included <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/788/14788.xml">
Infocom</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/398/37398.xml">
Disney</link>.</p>
<p>

Well-known Westwood titles from the early 1990's include <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/721/2239721.xml">
Dune II</link></it>, <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/452/1619452.xml">
The Legend of Kyrandia</link></it>, and <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/495/3082495.xml">
Lands of Lore</link></it>. Westwood's greatest commercial success however came in 1995 with the release of the real-time strategy game <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/053/2053053.xml">
Command &amp; Conquer</link></it>. Building on the gameplay and interface ideas of <it>Dune II</it>, it added pre-rendered 3D graphics for gameplay sprites and video cinematics, an alternative pop/rock soundtrack with techno elements streamed from disk, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/197/20647197.xml">
modem</link> play. <it>Command &amp; Conquer</it>, <it>Kyrandia</it>, and <it>Lands of Lore</it> all spawned multiple sequels.</p>
<p>

In August 1998, Westwood was <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/133/16912133.xml">
acquired</link> by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/933/262933.xml">
Electronic Arts</link> for $122.5&nbsp;million in cash. At the time, Westwood had 5% to 6% of the PC game market.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> In response to EA's buyout, many long-time Westwood employees quit and left Westwood Studios. Because of this and EA's newly imposed demands, games being developed by Westwood Studios at the time were rushed and left unfinished upon their release, namely <it><link xlink:label="command &amp; conquer" xlink:type="none" xlink:title=" Tiberian Sun"></link></it>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> All the subsequent games developed by Westwood were also heavily subjected to increased control by Electronic Arts, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/485/20967485.xml">
with some of them being cancelled</link>.</p>
<p>

Along with Westwood, EA had also acquired <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/852/1027852.xml">
Virgin Interactive</link>'s development studio based in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/333/5201333.xml">
Irvine, California</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> It was managed by Westwood and became known as Westwood Pacific, and later <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/475/1119475.xml">
EA Pacific</link>. Westwood Pacific developed or co-developed games like <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/841/867841.xml">
Nox</link></it> and <it><link xlink:label="command &amp; conquer" xlink:type="none" xlink:title=" Red Alert 2"></link></it>, which takes place in an alternate universe to that of the original title <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/053/2053053.xml">
Command &amp; Conquer</link></it>. One of the last games released by Westwood, <it><link xlink:label="command &amp; conquer" xlink:type="none" xlink:title=" Renegade"></link></it> (an action game, which mixed elements from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/149/25395149.xml">
first-person shooter</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/251/77251.xml">
real-time strategy</link> games) failed to meet consumer expectations and commercial goals Electronic Arts had set for it. In March of 2003, Westwood Studios (along with EA Pacific) was liquidated by EA, and all willing staff were assimilated into <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/475/1119475.xml">
EA Los Angeles</link>. Their last video game was <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/057/208057.xml">
Earth &amp; Beyond</link></it>, a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/844/20844.xml">
massively multiplayer online role-playing game</link> (MMORPG).</p>
<p>

At the time of its liquidation, Westwood employed a third of the original Westwood Studios personnel, some of which formed <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/597/1337597.xml">
Petroglyph Games</link> in April 2003, along with three of them (Brett Sperry, Adam Isgreen and Rade Stojsavljevic) forming Jet Set Games <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/399/32399.xml">
development studio</link> in 2008, both based in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/737/47737.xml">
Las Vegas, Nevada</link>.</p>
