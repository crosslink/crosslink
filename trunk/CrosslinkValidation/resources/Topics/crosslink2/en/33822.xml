<b>Westwood Studios</b> was a video game developer, based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was founded by Brett Sperry and Louis Castle in 1985 as <b>Westwood Associates</b> and was renamed Westwood Studios when it merged with Virgin Interactive in 1992. The company was bought from Virgin Interactive by Electronic Arts (EA) in 1998, and closed by EA in 2003.</p>
<p>

Westwood is best known for developing real-time strategy, adventure and role-playing genres. It received an entry to the Guinness book of records, for selling more than 10&nbsp;million copies of <it>Command &amp; Conquer</it> worldwide. Electronic Arts continues to develop games based on Westwood's <it>Command &amp; Conquer</it> series. The last former Westwood employee quit working for Electronic Arts after the release of <it></it> in 2003.</p>

 History </st>
<p>

The company's first projects consisted of contract work for companies like Epyx and Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI), porting 8-bit titles to 16-bit systems like Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Proceeds from contract work allowed the company to expand into designing its own games in-house. Their first original title was <it>Mars Saga</it>, a game developed for Electronic Arts and released in 1988. They pioneered the genre of real-time strategy with the release of <it></it>, one of the more literal translations of the classic tabletop game BattleTech. One of the company's first great successes was <it>Eye of the Beholder</it> (1990), a real-time role-playing video game based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons license, developed for SSI. Other publishers of early Westwood games included Infocom and Disney.</p>
<p>

Well-known Westwood titles from the early 1990's include <it>Dune II</it>, <it>The Legend of Kyrandia</it>, and <it>Lands of Lore</it>. Westwood's greatest commercial success however came in 1995 with the release of the real-time strategy game <it>Command &amp; Conquer</it>. Building on the gameplay and interface ideas of <it>Dune II</it>, it added pre-rendered 3D graphics for gameplay sprites and video cinematics, an alternative pop/rock soundtrack with techno elements streamed from disk, and modem play. <it>Command &amp; Conquer</it>, <it>Kyrandia</it>, and <it>Lands of Lore</it> all spawned multiple sequels.</p>
<p>

In August 1998, Westwood was acquired by Electronic Arts for $122.5&nbsp;million in cash. At the time, Westwood had 5% to 6% of the PC game market.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> In response to EA's buyout, many long-time Westwood employees quit and left Westwood Studios. Because of this and EA's newly imposed demands, games being developed by Westwood Studios at the time were rushed and left unfinished upon their release, namely <it></it>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> All the subsequent games developed by Westwood were also heavily subjected to increased control by Electronic Arts, with some of them being cancelled.</p>
<p>

Along with Westwood, EA had also acquired Virgin Interactive's development studio based in Irvine, California.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> It was managed by Westwood and became known as Westwood Pacific, and later EA Pacific. Westwood Pacific developed or co-developed games like <it>Nox</it> and <it></it>, which takes place in an alternate universe to that of the original title <it>Command &amp; Conquer</it>. One of the last games released by Westwood, <it></it> (an action game, which mixed elements from first-person shooters and real-time strategy games) failed to meet consumer expectations and commercial goals Electronic Arts had set for it. In March of 2003, Westwood Studios (along with EA Pacific) was liquidated by EA, and all willing staff were assimilated into EA Los Angeles. Their last video game was <it>Earth &amp; Beyond</it>, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).</p>
<p>

At the time of its liquidation, Westwood employed a third of the original Westwood Studios personnel, some of which formed Petroglyph Games in April 2003, along with three of them (Brett Sperry, Adam Isgreen and Rade Stojsavljevic) forming Jet Set Games development studio in 2008, both based in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
