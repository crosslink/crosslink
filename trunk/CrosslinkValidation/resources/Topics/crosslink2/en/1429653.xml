Career</st>
<p>

Lee made her debut as a TV model in 1991. After appearing in TV commercials, she started playing in TV dramas and movies. </p>
<p>

Her popularity has grown in an exponential manner due to her performance in the popular Korean drama <it>Dae Jang Geum</it>. After the successful broadcast in Korea, it was then shown oversea the first time in 2004 and won many hearts of audience in Taiwan.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> In 2005, nearly half of the Hong Kong population watched the final episode of the drama.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In China, hundreds of million viewers watched the drama though it was shown late at night.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>

Beside her acting career, she has also been involved in several charity events. In 1997 she went to Ethiopia as a NGO Goodwill Ambassador.  She went to Thar Desert in 1999 doing a <weblink xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=wy_woo_lya_Thar&amp;so=1&amp;emb=0#q=wy_woo_lya_Thar&amp;so=1&amp;emb=0&amp;filter=0&amp;start=0">

<p>

She was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador  in 2004 by UNICEF and held several charity functions from that time on.

From her 2006 autobiography “Young-Ae’s Vow”,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> she talked about how she became an actress. She recalled what made her go into show business was working with Andy Lau in a 1991 chocolate advertisement. In 1995, she made a decision to go to graduate school to learn theory of acting. Since then, she has not changed to challenge various kinds of acting roles, like that in Dae Jang Geum and later a very different role in Sympathy For Lady Vengeance.</p>
