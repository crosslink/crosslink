Type of Sushi
</caption>
</image>

 is a Japanese dish consisting of cooked vinegared rice which is commonly topped with other ingredients, such as fish or other seafood,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref> or put into rolls.
Sliced raw fish by itself is called <it>sashimi</it>, as distinct from <it>sushi</it>. Sushi that is served rolled inside or around dried and pressed sheets of seaweed (or <it>nori</it>) is <it>makizushi</it> (巻き). Toppings stuffed into a small pouch of fried tofu is <it>inarizushi</it>. A bowl of sushi rice with toppings scattered over it is called <it>chirashi-zushi</it> (ちらし).

History</st>
<p>


Image:Hiroshige Bowl of Sushi.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Sushi by Hiroshige in Edo period]]
The traditional form of sushi is fermented fish and rice, preserved with salt in a process that has been traced to Southeast Asia, where it remains popular today.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> The term <it>sushi</it> comes from an archaic grammatical form no longer used in other contexts; literally, "sushi" means "it's sour",<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> a reflection of its historic fermented roots.</p>
<p>

The science behind the fermentation of fish packed in rice is that the vinegar produced from fermenting rice breaks the fish down into amino acids. This results in one of the five basic tastes, called <it>umami</it> in Japanese.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> The oldest form of sushi in Japan, <it>Narezushi</it>, still very closely resembles this process. In Japan, Narezushi evolved into Oshizushi and ultimately Edomae nigirizushi, which is what the world today knows as "sushi."</p>
<p>

Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Originally, when the fermented fish was taken out of the rice, only the fish was consumed and the fermented rice was discarded. The strong-tasting and smelling <it>funazushi</it>, a kind of <it>narezushi</it> made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional fermented dish. Beginning in the Muromachi period (AD 1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added to the mixture for better taste and preservation. The vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase its life span, allowing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved into <it>oshi-zushi</it>. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden (usually bamboo) molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>
<p>

The contemporary version, internationally known as "sushi," was created by Hanaya Yohei (華屋与兵衛; 1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. The sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be eaten with one's hands by a road or in a theatre.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> Originally, this sushi was known as <it>Edomae zushi</it> because it used freshly caught fish in the <it>Edo-mae</it> (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay). Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as <it>Edomae nigirizushi</it>.</p>

Types</st>
<p>

The common ingredient across all the different kinds of sushi is <it>sushi rice</it>. The variety in sushi arises from the different fillings and toppings, condiments, and the way these ingredients are put together. The same ingredients may be assembled in a traditional or a contemporary way, creating a very different final result.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>
In spelling <b>sushi</b> its first letter <it>s</it> is replaced with <it>z</it> when a prefix is attached, as in <b>nigirizushi,</b> due to consonant mutation called rendaku in Japanese.</p>

 Nigirizushi  </st>
<p>

<it>Nigirizushi</it>  (握り寿司, lit. hand-formed  sushi)  consists of an oblong mound of <it>sushi rice</it> that is pressed between the palms of the hands, usually with a bit of <it>wasabi</it>, and a topping draped over it. Toppings are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus (<it>tako</it>), freshwater eel (<it>unagi</it>), sea eel (<it>anago</it>), squid (<it>ika</it>), and sweet egg (<it>tamago</it>). When ordered separately, nigiri is generally served in pairs. A sushi set may contain only one piece of each topping.</p>
<p>

<it>Gunkanmaki</it> (軍艦巻, lit. warship roll) is a special type of <it>nigirizushi</it>: an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of "nori" wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of <it>nori</it> such as roe, <it>natto</it>, oysters, sea urchin, corn with mayonnaise, and quail eggs.<it>Gunkan-maki</it> was invented at the <it>Ginza Kyubey</it> restaurant in 1931;<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref> its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.</p>
<p>

<it>Temarizushi</it> (手まり寿司, lit. ball sushi) is a  ball-shaped sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap. They are quite easy to make and thus a good starting point for beginners.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>

<it>Makizushi</it> (巻寿司, lit. rolled sushi) or <it>makimono</it> (巻物, lit. variety of rolls) is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat, called a <it>makisu</it> (巻簾). <it>Makizushi</it> is generally wrapped in nori, but can occasionally be found wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or parsley. <it>Makizushi</it> is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist.</p>
<p>

<it>Futomaki</it> (太巻, lit. thick, large or fat rolls) is a large cylindrical piece, with nori on the outside. A typical <it>futomaki</it> is three or four centimeters (1.5&nbsp;in) in diameter. They are often made with two or three fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in Kansai to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is particularly called ehou-maki (恵方巻, lit. happy direction rolls). Futomaki is often vegetarian, but may include non-vegetarian toppings such as tiny fish roe and chopped tuna.</p>
<p>

<it>Hosomaki</it> (細巻, lit. thin rolls) is a small cylindrical piece, with the nori on the outside. A typical <it>hosomaki</it> has a diameter of about two centimeters (0.75&nbsp;in). They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, kanpyō, thinly sliced carrots, or, more recently, avocado. <it>Kappamaki</it>, (河童巻) a kind of <it>Hosomaki</it> filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, <it>Kappamaki</it> is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods. <it>Tekkamaki</it> (鉄火巻) is a kind of <it>Hosomaki</it> filled with raw tuna. Although some believe that the name "Tekka", meaning 'red hot iron', alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called "Tekkaba (鉄火場)", much like the sandwich.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> <it>Negitoromaki</it> (ねぎとろ巻) is a kind of <it>Hosomaki</it> filled with scallion and chopped tuna. Fatty tuna is often used in this style.  <it>Tsunamayomaki</it> (ツナマヨ巻) is a kind of <it>Hosomaki</it> filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.</p>
<p>

<it>Temaki</it> (手巻, lit. hand rolls) is a large cone-shaped piece of nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical <it>temaki</it> is about ten centimeters (4&nbsp;in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, <it>Temaki</it> must be eaten quickly after being made because the nori cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness and becomes somewhat difficult to bite.</p>
<p>

<it>Uramaki</it> (裏巻, lit. inside-out rolls) is a medium-sized cylindrical piece, with two or more fillings. <it>Uramaki</it> differs from other <it>makimono</it> because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside. The filling is in the center surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and an outer coating of some other ingredients such as <it>roe</it> or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber, carrots. Uramaki has not been so popular in Japan and most of makimono is not uramaki because it is easy to hold makimono with nori skin by fingers. However, since some Western people dislike the black impression of makimono with nori skin, uramaki has become more popular in Western countries than nori-skined makimono.</p>

Oshizushi</st>
<p>

Oshizushi (押し寿司, lit. pressed sushi), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai Region, a favourite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece formed using a wooden mold, called an oshibako. The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Inarizushi</st>
<p>


<it>Inarizushi</it> (稲荷寿司, stuffed sushi) is a pouch of fried tofu filled with usually just sushi rice. It is named after the Shinto god <it>Inari</it>, who is believed to have a fondness for fried tofu. The pouch is normally fashioned as deep-fried tofu (油揚げ, abura age). Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (帛紗寿司, fukusa-zushi or 茶巾寿司, chakin-zushi).  It should not be confused with <it>inari maki</it>, which is a  roll filled with flavored fried tofu. A very large version, sweeter than normal and often containing bits of carrot, is popular in Hawaii, where it is called "cone sushi."</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Sukeroku</st>

<p>

<it>Sukeroku</it> (助六, name of a man in Edo period) is the combination set of inarizushi and makizushi, which is served as a single-portion takeout style sushi-pack.  In a famous Kabuki play <it>Sukeroku</it>,  a good-looking man Sukeroku is the lover of an Oiran courtesan named Agemaki (揚巻, lit. fry for <it>age</it> and roll for <it>maki</it>).  <it>Age</it> and <it>maki</it> which form her name correspond to fried tofu namely inari and makimono, respectively.  One rumour of sukeroku-zushi is that takeout style packs of inarizushi and makizushi had served at performances of Sukeroku kabuki in Edo period.  Sukeroku is a cheap sushi-pack and often vegetarian.</p>

</image>

<it>Chirashizushi</it> (ちらし寿司, lit. scattered sushi) is a bowl of sushi rice with other ingredients mixed in (also refers to <it>barazushi</it>). It is commonly eaten in Japan because it is filling, fast and easy to make. <it>Chirashizushi</it> most often varies regionally because it is eaten annually as a part of <it>the Doll Festival</it>, celebrated only during March in Japan.  The ingredients are often chef's choice.  <it>Edomae chirashizushi</it> (Edo-style scattered sushi) is an uncooked ingredient that is arranged artfully on top of the sushi rice in a bowl. <it>Gomokuzushi</it> (Kansai-style sushi) are cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of rice in a bowl.</p>

Narezushi</st>
<p>

<it>Narezushi</it> (熟れ寿司, lit. matured sushi) is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months this <it>funazushi</it> can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more.</p>

The increasing popularity of <it>sushi</it> around the world has resulted in variations of sushi typically found in the West but rarely if at all in Japan. Such creations to suit the Western palate<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll. A wide variety of popular rolls has evolved since. Some examples include:</p>

Other rolls may include scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken or teriyaki roll, okra, and vegetables. Sushi rolls can be made with brown rice and black rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.</p>
<p>

In Hawaii, there is a predominant style of maki sushi that includes shoyu tuna (canned not fresh), tamago, kanpyō, kamaboko, and the distinctive red and green hana ebi (shrimp powder).</p>

Ingredients</st>
<p>

All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.</p>

<ss1>
<st>
Sushi rice</st>
<p>

Sushi is made with white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing made of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally  kombu and <it>sake</it>. It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a <it>sushi</it> or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji).</p>
<p>

Sushi rice (sushi-meshi or su-meshi 酢飯) is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness. Rice that is too sticky has a mushy texture; if not sticky enough, it feels dry. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.</p>
<p>

There are regional variations in sushi rice and, of course, individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kanto region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.</p>

</ss1>
<ss1>
<st>
Nori</st>
<p>

Image:Nori.jpg|thumb|180px|A sheet of nori.]]
The black seaweed wrappers used in <it>makimono</it> are called nori. Nori is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into  thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making  rice paper. Whereas in Japan, nori may never be toasted before being used in food, many brands found in the U.S. reach drying temperatures above .</p>
<p>

Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in standard-size sheets about . Higher quality nori is thick, smooth, shiny, green, and has no holes. When stored for several months, nori sheets can change color to dark green-brownish.</p>
<p>

The standard size of a whole nori sheet mentioned above influences the size of maki-mono. A full size sheet produces futomaki, and a half produces hosomaki and temaki.  To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet.</p>
<p>

Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.</p>
<p>

When making <it>fukusazushi</it>, a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.</p>

<p>

For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, fish eaten raw must be fresher and of higher quality than fish which is cooked. The FDA recommends that raw fish be frozen before being consumed, as this will kill all parasites (but not all harmful microorganisms).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref> Professional sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly-used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is <it>toro,</it> the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning middle toro, implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. <it>Aburi</it> style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw.  Most nigiri sushi will be completely raw.</p>
<p>

Other seafoods such as  squid (<it>ika</it>), eel (<it>anago</it> and <it>unagi</it>), pike conger (<it>hamo</it>), octopus (<it>tako</it>), shrimp (<it>ebi</it> and <it>amaebi</it>), clam (<it>mirugai</it>, <it>aoyagi</it> and <it>akagi</it>), fish roe (<it>ikura</it>, <it>masago</it>, <it>kazunoko</it> and <it>tobiko</it>), sea urchin (<it>uni</it>), crab (<it>kani</it>), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. Kani kama, or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.</p>

Condiments</st>
<p>

Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu, soy sauce, and may be flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated root of the <it>Wasabia japonica</it> plant.</p>
<p>

True wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or <it>samegawa oroshi</it>. An imitation wasabi (<it>seiyo-wasabi</it>), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside of Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled "Japanese Horseradish".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref></p>
<p>

Gari, sweet, pickled ginger is eaten with sushi to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion.  In Japan, green tea (<it>ocha</it>) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as <it>mecha</it>. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as <it>agari</it>.</p>

 The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. The same may not be said categorically of Western-style sushi, which increasingly features non-traditional ingredients such as mayonnaise, avocado, and cream cheese.</p>
<p>

Most seafood is naturally low in fat, with fats found in seafood predominately being unsaturated and thus containing relatively high levels of Omega-3. Since sushi is often served raw, no cooking fat is introduced during its preparation. Some non-traditional ingredients such as cream cheese and mayonnaise that are sometimes found in Western-style sushi dishes can add significant amounts of fat to a traditionally lean dish.</p>
<p>

Fish, tofu, seafood, egg, and many other sushi fillings contain high levels of protein. Imitation meat such as krab stick may be lower in protein and other nutrition than their natural, unprocessed counterparts.</p>
<p>

Vitamins and minerals are found in much of the seafood and vegetables used for sushi. The nutritional content is dependent on the ingredients used. For example, Shrimp are high in calcium and iodine, while salmon are rich in Vitamin D. The gari and nori used to make sushi are both rich in nutrients. Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>

Carbohydrates are found in the rice and the vegetables. Certain non-traditional ingredients can raise the carbohydrate level quite high, as with the fat level.</p>

As with most foods, sushi is not free from health risks, but these risks are minimized with proper preparation and service. Some large fish, such as tuna (especially bluefin), can harbor high levels of mercury.  This is due to the tuna's position at the top of the food chain (among sea creatures).  Thus, tuna can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in quantity.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

Parasite infection by raw fish is rare in the modern world (fewer than 40 cases per year in the U.S.), and involves mainly three kinds of parasites: Clonorchis sinensis (a trematode/fluke), Anisakis (a nematode/roundworm) and Diphyllobothrium (a cestode/tapeworm).<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref>  Infection risk of anisakis is particularly higher in fish which may live in a river such as salmon (<it>shake</it>) in Salmonidae, and mackerel (<it>saba</it>).  Such parasite infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing overnight.</p>
<p>

For the above reasons, the EU regulation No 853/2004<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref> forbids the use of fresh raw fish; it has to be frozen at a temperature of not more than -20 °C in all parts of the product for not less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>

Some forms of sushi, notably glogfish or puffer fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly.  Particularly, fugu has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref></p>

<p>

Traditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.</p>
<p>

Many sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as <it>shō-chiku-bai</it> (松竹梅), shō/<it>matsu</it> (松, pine), chiku/<it>take</it> (竹, bamboo) and bai/<it>ume</it> (梅, ume), with <it>matsu</it> the most expensive and <it> ume</it> the cheapest.</p>
<p>

In Japan, and increasingly abroad, sushi is served <it>kaiten zushi</it> (sushi train) style.  Color coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use RFID tags embedded in the dishes to bill automatically and manage elapsed time after cooked.</p>

Etiquette</st>

<p>

Nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, since sushi rice is packed loosely so as to fall apart in one's mouth.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2224%22])">24</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2225%22])">25</ref>  This is allowed even in formal settings.  However, this has become <it>over-etiquette</it> today.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2226%22])">26</ref> Instead, most Japanese now eat sushi with chopsticks.</p>
<p>

Soy sauce may be poured into a small sauce dish. While many dip the rice side into the soy sauce, traditional etiquette insists instead that the sushi is turned over so that the topping is dipped, as proper loosely packed rice might fall apart. If it is difficult to turn the sushi, one can smear soy sauce, using <it>gari</it> as a brush. Mixing wasabi and soy sauce together is the practice when eating sashimi, however it is not proper etiquette when eating sushi.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>
