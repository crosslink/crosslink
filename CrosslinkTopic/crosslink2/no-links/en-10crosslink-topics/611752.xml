Different types of ravioli and other filled pasta
</caption>
</image>

<b>Ravioli</b> (plural; singular: raviolo) are a traditional type of Italian filled <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/871/23871.xml">
pasta</link>. They are composed of a filling sealed between two layers of thin egg pasta dough and are served either in broth or with a <link>
pasta sauce</link>. The word <it>ravioli</it> is reminiscent of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/708/14708.xml">
Italian</link> verb <it>riavvolgere</it> ("to wrap"), though the two words are not etymologically connected. The word may also be a diminutive of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/708/14708.xml">
Italian</link> dialectal <it>rava</it>, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/576/46576.xml">

History</st>

The earliest mention of ravioli appear in the writings of Francesco di Marco, a merchant of Venice in the 14th century.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>
In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/616/32616.xml">
Venice</link>, the mid-14th century manuscript <it>Libro per cuoco</it> offers ravioli of green herbs blanched and minced, mixed with beaten egg and fresh cheese, simmered in broth, a recipe that would be familiar today save for its medieval powdering of "sweet and strong spices".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In Tuscany, some of the earliest mentions of the dish come from the personal letters of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/627/10184627.xml">
Francesco di Marco Datini</link>, a merchant of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/975/1821975.xml">

Making of ravioli
</caption>
</image>

Today, ravioli are made in worldwide industrial lines supplied by Italian companies such as <link>
Arienti &amp; Cattaneo</link>, Ima, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/035/11745035.xml">
Ostoni</link>, and Zamboni. Italian fresh pasta has a shelf-life of 30 days.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref>   "Fresh" packed ravioli have in USA seven weeks of shelf life. Canned ravioli was pioneered by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/674/1032674.xml">
Chef Boyardee</link>.  This type of ravioli is filled with either beef or processed cheese and served in a tomato, tomato-meat, or tomato-cheese sauce.  Canned ravioli has more in common with other <link>
canned pastas</link> than with traditional ravioli dishes.  Its roots are in traditional American "<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/534/16965534.xml">
red sauce</link>" <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/320/125320.xml">
Italian-American</link> restaurants opened by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/155/385155.xml">
Italian</link> immigrants in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/894/24437894.xml">
Boston</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/131/8210131.xml">
New York</link> and other cities. <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/826/1066826.xml">
Toasted ravioli</link>, ravioli that have been breaded and deep fried, were first developed in St. Louis, Missouri, and are a popular appetizer or snack food.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

In other cultures</st>
<p>

In India, a popular dish called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/395/16606395.xml">
Gujiya</link> is similar to ravioli however its prepared sweet, with a filing of dry fruits, sugar and a mixture of sweet spices, then deep fried in vegetable oil. The dish is a popular food prepared during the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/575/489575.xml">
Holi</link> festival, mainly in the northern, northwestern and central parts of India.</p>
<p>

Similar dishes in other cultures include the Chinese jiaozi or wonton; in fact, ravioli and tortellini are sometimes collectively referred to as "Italian jiaozi" (意大利饺子) or "Italian wonton" (意大利馄饨). A similar middle-eastern dish called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/764/20467764.xml">
shishbarak</link> contains pasta filled with minced beef meat and cooked in hot yogurt.</p>
