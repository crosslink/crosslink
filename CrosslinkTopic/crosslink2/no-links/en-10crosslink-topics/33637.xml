Wasabi is generally sold either as a root which is very finely grated before use, or as a ready-to-use paste in tubes similar to travel <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/735/147735.xml">
toothpaste</link> tubes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> In restaurants the paste is prepared when the  customer orders, and is made using a grater to grate the root; once the paste is prepared, it loses flavor in 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/271/28271.xml">
sushi</link> preparation, sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice because covering wasabi until served preserves its flavor.</p>
<p>

Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten, having the spicy flavor of wasabi roots.</p>
<p>

Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil-based, they are short-lived compared to the effects of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/225/74225.xml">
chili pepper</link>s, and are washed away with more food or liquid. The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be quite painful depending on amount taken.</p>
<p>

<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/286/305286.xml">
Legume</link>s (peanuts, soybeans, or peas) may be roasted or fried, then coated with wasabi powder mixed with sugar, salt, or oil and eaten as a crunchy snack.  Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/067/1156067.xml">
smelling salts</link>, a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf. One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within 10&nbsp;seconds of wasabi vapor being sprayed into his sleeping chamber.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref> This was "rewarded" with the <link>
2011 Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry</link> to Makoto Imai, Naoki Urushihata, Hideki Tanemura, Yukinobu Tajima, Hideaki Goto, Koichiro Mizoguchi and Junichi Murakami for determining the ideal density of airborne wasabi (pungent horseradish) to wake people in event of an emergency.</p>

True wasabi and western wasabi</st>
<p>

Wasabi is difficult to cultivate (see below), and that makes it quite expensive&nbsp;— as high as $70 to $100 per pound. Due to its high cost, a common substitute is a mixture of (western) horseradish (which normally costs less than $1/pound wholesale), mustard, and green food coloring. Although the taste is similar they are easily distinguished. In Japan, horseradish is referred to as .<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref> Outside Japan, "real" wasabi is rare, and colored horseradish-based substitute is normally used instead; in the United States, wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high-end restaurants.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

Chemistry</st>
<p>

The chemical in wasabi that provides for its initial pungency is the volatile <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/787/1576787.xml">
allyl isothiocyanate</link>, which is produced by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/385/14385.xml">
hydrolysis</link> of natural rhizome thioglucosides (conjugates of the sugar glucose, and sulfur-containing organic compounds); the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs on when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration&nbsp;— <it>e.g.</it>, grating&nbsp;— of the plant's rhizome.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref></p>
<p>

The unique flavor of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the rhizome, including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides into glucose and methylthioalkyl <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/230/377230.xml">
isothiocyanate</link>s:<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

Research has shown that such isothiocyanates inhibit <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/377/20377.xml">

Few places are suitable for large-scale wasabi cultivation, and cultivation is difficult even in ideal conditions. In Japan, wasabi is cultivated mainly in these regions:</p>

There are also numerous artificially cultivated facilities as far north as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/092/58092.xml">
Hokkaidō</link> and as far south as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/914/16914.xml">
Kyūshū</link>. As the demand for real wasabi is very high, Japan has to import a large amount of it from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/405/5405.xml">
China</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/846/989846.xml">

Taiwan</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/064/4913064.xml">
New Zealand</link>.</p>
<p>

In North America, a handful of companies and small farmers are successfully pursuing the trend by cultivating <it>Wasabia japonica</it>. While only the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/147/78147.xml">
Pacific Northwest</link> and parts of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/535/462535.xml">
Blue Ridge Mountains</link> provide the right balance of climate and water for natural cultivation of sawa (water grown) wasabi, the use of hydroponics and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/996/86996.xml">
greenhouses</link> has extended the range.</p>

While the finest sawa wasabi is grown in pure, constantly flowing water, without pesticides or fertilizers, some growers push growth with fertilizer such as chicken manure, which can be a source of downstream pollution if not properly managed.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref></p>

Wasabi is often grated with a metal <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/657/519657.xml">
oroshigane</link></it>, but some prefer to use a more traditional tool made of dried <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/386/16834386.xml">
sharkskin</link> with fine skin on one side and coarse skin on the other. A hand-made grater with irregular teeth can also be used. If a shark-skin grater is unavailable, ceramic is usually preferred.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>

Etymology</st>
<p>

The two <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/604/37604.xml">
kanji</link> characters "" and "" do not correspond to their pronunciation: as such it is an example of <link>
gikun</link> (meaning, not sound). The two characters actually refer to the <it>mountain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/879/460879.xml">
Asarum</link></it>, as the plant's leaves resemble those of a member of Asarum species, in addition to its ability to grow on shady hillsides. The word, in the form , appeared in 918 in <it>The Japanese Names of Medical Herbs</it> ( <it>Honzō Wamyō</it>). Spelled in this way, the particular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/604/37604.xml">
kanji</link> are used for their phonetic values only, known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/878/1790878.xml">
ateji</link> (sound, not meaning&nbsp;— opposite of gikun).</p>
