<b>Xylitol</b> (; , <it>xyl[on],</it> "wood" + suffix -<it>itol</it>, used to denote sugar alcohols) is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/526/562526.xml">
sugar alcohol</link> sweetener used as a naturally occurring <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/880/58880.xml">

fiber</link>s of many <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/843/10843.xml">
fruit</link>s and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/492/5791492.xml">

<p>

As with other sugar alcohols, with the exception of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/700/668700.xml">
erythritol</link>, consumption in excess of one's laxation threshold (the amount of sweetener that can be consumed before abdominal discomfort sets in) can result in temporary gastrointestinal side effects, such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/874/2200874.xml">
bloating</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/240/11240.xml">
flatulence</link>, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/951/53951.xml">
diarrhea</link>. Adaptation, an increase of the laxation threshold, occurs with regular intake. Xylitol has a lower laxation threshold than some sugar alcohols, but is more easily tolerated than others such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/846/1015846.xml">
mannitol</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/360/56360.xml">

Xylitol is an <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/203/22203.xml">
organic compound</link> with the formula (CHOH)3(CH2OH)2. This <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/166/1170166.xml">

Xylitol was discovered almost simultaneously by German and French chemists in the late 19th century, and was first popularized in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/239/9239.xml">
Europe</link> as a safe sweetener for people with <link>
diabetes</link> that would not impact <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/895/14895.xml">

Dental care</st>
<p>

Xylitol is a “tooth-friendly”, nonfermentable sugar alcohol.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> A systematic review study<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> on the efficacy of xylitol has indicated dental health benefits in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/350/414350.xml">
caries</link> prevention, showing superior performance to other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/995/1554995.xml">
polyol</link>s (polyalcohols).
This is because the structure of xylitol contains a tridentate ligand, (H-C-OH)3 that can rearrange with polyvalent cations like Ca++. This interaction allows for Ca++ to be transported through the gut wall barrier and through saliva may remineralize enamel before dental caries forms.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

Early studies from Finland in the 1970s found that a group chewing sucrose gum had 2.92 decayed, missing, or filled (dmf) teeth compared to 1.04 in the group chewing xylitol gums.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref> Recent research<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> confirms a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/622/2323622.xml">
plaque</link>-reducing effect and suggests the compound, having some chemical properties similar to <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/563/50563.xml">
sucrose</link>, attracts and then "starves" harmful micro-organisms, allowing the mouth to remineralize damaged teeth with less interruption. (However, this same effect also interferes with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/385/34385.xml">
yeast</link> micro-organisms and others, so xylitol is inappropriate for making yeast-based <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/969/36969.xml">
bread</link>, for instance.) This is because cariogenic bacteria prefer fermentable six-carbon sugars, or disacharrides such as sucrose, as opposed to the nonfermentable xylitol, whose antimicrobial properties then "starve" the bacteria, reducing their growth and reproduction.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Most of these studies suggest that at least 6&nbsp;grams of xylitol per day is needed for dental efficacy; for most chewing gum or breath mints this would require 12 pieces per day (op cit).</p>
<p>

Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/077/1917077.xml">
mutans streptococci</link> group, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/799/9028799.xml">
bacteria</link> that are significant contributors to tooth decay.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> Xylitol inhibits mutans streptococci in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/337/50337.xml">
fructose</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref> Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44&nbsp;grams are ineffective, and doses above 10.32&nbsp;grams show no additional benefit.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
<p>

Saliva containing xylitol is more <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/ury/30th_century.xml">
alkali</link>ne than saliva which contains other sugar products. After taking xylitol products, the concentration of basic amino acids in saliva may rise. When saliva is alkaline (i.e., its <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/530/24530.xml">
pH</link> is above 7), calcium and  phosphate salts in saliva start to precipitate into those parts of enamel where they are lacking.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2219%22])">19</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2220%22])">20</ref></p>
<p>

Xylitol also inhibits the growth of <it>Streptococcus pneumoniae</it>, as well as the attachment of <it>Haemophilus influenzae</it> on the nasopharyngeal cells, making xylitol nose spray a very marketable product.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>
<p>

Xylitol-based products are allowed by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/632/11632.xml">
U.S. Food and Drug Administration</link> to make the medical claim that they do not promote dental cavities.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2221%22])">21</ref></p>
<p>

A recent study demonstrated, as a water additive for cats, xylitol was effective in reducing plaque and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/812/252812.xml">
calculus</link> accumulation.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2222%22])">22</ref> However, there is evidence xylitol may be <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//*[./st=%22Dogs%22])">
dangerous to dogs</link>.</p>

Possessing approximately 40% less food energy,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2223%22])">23</ref> xylitol is a low-<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/423/6423.xml">

Xylitol also has potential as a treatment for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/461/22461.xml">

Studies have shown xylitol chewing gum can help prevent ear infections<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref> (acute <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/199/215199.xml">

earwax</link> and clearing the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/972/55972.xml">

eustachian tubes</link> (auditory or pharyngotympanic tubes) which connect the nose and ear.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> When bacteria enter the body, they adhere to the tissues using a variety of sugar complexes. The open nature of xylitol and its ability to form many different sugar-like structures appears to interfere with the ability of many bacteria to adhere.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref>  In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, saline solutions of xylitol significantly reduced the number of nasal coagulase-negative <it>Staphylococcus</it> bacteria. The researchers attributed the benefits to the increased effectiveness of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/808/790808.xml">
endogenous</link> (naturally present in the body) antimicrobial factors.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref> In a small clinical trial nasally administered xylitol reduced ear complaints in children previously having chronic complaints, on the order of almost one a month, by more than 92%.

Xylitol has no known <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/567/170567.xml">

In one study, the participants consumed a diet containing a monthly average of 1.5&nbsp;kg of xylitol with a maximum daily intake of 430&nbsp;g with no apparent ill effects.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref> Like most sugar alcohols, it has a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/526/168526.xml">
laxative</link> effect because sugar alcohols are not fully broken down during digestion; albeit one-tenth the strength of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/360/56360.xml">
