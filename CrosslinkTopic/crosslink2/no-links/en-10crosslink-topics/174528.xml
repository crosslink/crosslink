Sikhism</link>, and other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/605/14605.xml">
Indian religions</link>. In modern parlance, samsara refers to a place, set of objects and possessions, but originally, the word referred to a process of continuous pursuit or flow of life. In accordance with the literal meaning, the word should either refer to a continuous stream of consciousness, or the continuous but random drift of passions, desires, emotions, and experiences.<p>

In most Indian religions, life is not considered to begin with birth and end in death, but as a continuous existence in the present lifetime of the organism and extending beyond. The nature of the actions (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/864/16864.xml">
karma</link>) committed during the course of each lifetime, (good or ill) determines the future destiny of each being. Samsara is closely linked with the idea of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/008/98008.xml">
rebirth</link> (or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/806/25806.xml">
reincarnation</link>), but mainly refers to the condition of life, and the experience of life.</p>
<p>

In Buddhism, at the moment of death the consciousness (consciousness of the different senses, such as eye consciousness, ear consciousness etc.), acts as the seed for the spawning of the new consciousness in a new biological structure, conducive to the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/508/317508.xml">
volitional</link> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/684/2935684.xml">
Saṅkhāras</link>) impulses at the moment of death (which are themselves affected by previous volitional impulses). In other Indian religions, the volitional impulses accrued from the present life are transmitted to a consciousness structure popularly known as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/297/28297.xml">
soul</link>, which, after an intermediate period (in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/939/5451939.xml">
Tibetan</link> called the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/632/327632.xml">
bardo</link>), forms the basis for a new biological structure that will result in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/706/456706.xml">
rebirth</link> and a new life. This cyclical process ends in the attainment of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/918/175918.xml">
moksha</link>. If one lives in extremely evil ways, one may be reborn as an animal or other unfortunate being.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref></p>
<p>

In a modern vernacular context, particularly in the Himalayas, samsara is  also a word used to describe the how life is full of attachments and comings-and-goings, a subtle state of suffering. For example, when saying goodbye to a loved one, one might utter, "ah... samsara." </p>

<sec>
<st>
Etymology and origin</st>
<p>

Samsara means "to flow on", to perpetually wander, to pass through states of existence. </p>
<p>

The historical origins of a concept of a cycle of repeated <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/806/25806.xml">
reincarnation</link> are obscure but the idea appears frequently in religious and philosophical texts in both India and ancient Greece during the middle of the first millennium BCE.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/597/4354597.xml">
Orphism</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/011/2221011.xml">
Platonism</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/016/16016.xml">
Jainism</link> and Buddhism all discuss the transmigration of beings from one life to another. . Reincarnation was adopted from this religious culture by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/576/10373576.xml">
Brahmin</link> orthodoxy, and Brahmins first wrote down scriptures containing these ideas in the early <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/666/80666.xml">
Upanishads</link>.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%228%22])">8</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%229%22])">9</ref></p>
<p>

The Sanskrit word "Samsara" is the root for the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/630/126630.xml">
Malay</link> word "sengsara", which means suffering.</p>

</sec>
<sec>
<st>
Cycle of rebirth</st>
<p>

The concept of sansara is closely associated with the belief that one continues to be born and reborn in various realms in the form of a human, animal, or other being (depending on karma).
In particular, Jainism<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2210%22])">10</ref> maintains that, if one performs extremely evil <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/864/16864.xml">
karma</link>, one can be reborn also as a plant or even as a rock, and similar tendencies can be found in Purāṇas, in the Bhagavadgītā, in the Manusmṛti<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2211%22])">11</ref> and in similar texts. Nonetheless, most philosophic traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref> maintain that plants and even more obviously rocks cannot be included in saṃsāra since they lack the possibility of experience (bhoga) and, hence, of karma.</p>

<sec>
<st>
 in Hinduism</st>
<p>

In Hinduism, it is <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/441/699441.xml">
avidya</link>, or ignorance, of one's true self that leads to <link>
ego-consciousness</link> of the body and the phenomenal world. This grounds one in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/556/1434556.xml">
kāma</link> (desire) and the perpetual chain of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/864/16864.xml">
karma</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/806/25806.xml">
reincarnation</link>. Through egoism and desire one creates the causes for future becoming. The state of illusion that gives rise to this is known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/041/77041.xml">
Maya</link>.</p>
<p>

Through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/484/83484.xml">
ascetic</link> practice one finally attains sanctity and liberation (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/918/175918.xml">
moksha</link> or mukti).</p>
<p>

Broadly speaking, the holy life (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/023/373023.xml">
brahmacarya</link>) which leads to liberation is a path of self-purification by which the effects of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/307/28307.xml">
sin</link>s are released.</p>
<p>

The Hindu Yoga traditions hold various beliefs. Moksha may be achieved by love of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/811/1201811.xml">
Ishwar</link>/God (see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/568/175568.xml">
bhakti movement</link>, see <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/110/309110.xml">
Mirabai</link>), by psycho-physical meditation (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/346/628346.xml">
Raja Yoga</link>), by discrimination of what is real and unreal through intense contemplation (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/158/744158.xml">
Jnana Yoga</link>), and through <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/751/1381751.xml">
Karma Yoga</link>, the path of selfless action that subverts the ego and enforces understanding of the unity of all. </p>
<p>

The Rig Vedic, Yajur Vedic and Atharva Vedic Upanishads like Aiteraya Upanishad, Taittiriya Upanishad, Swetaswatara Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad etc. contains the most ancient ideas on Reincarnation of soul.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> As confirmed by latest research in the field of archeology and Astronomy, Vedas were older than 2600 BC which takes it far earlier than all other religious texts.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref> Hence, based on this, the earliest known texts to have spoken about karma, sansara and Moksha or Mukti, are the Vedas and other <it>Dharmic Texts</it>. (Dharmic Texts stands for the Vedas, Ithihasas and Puranas). The Vedas describe Karma as the result of enjoying the sensory pleasures of this material universe.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>

The concept of Saṃsara as a cycle of rebirth and suffering within the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/074/1029074.xml">
six realms</link> is taught in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/529/3267529.xml">
Buddhism</link>. To understand the concept of Saṃsara it is important to know about the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/074/1029074.xml">
six realms</link>, rebirth, karma, and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/233/21233.xml">

 in Sikhism</st>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/964/27964.xml">
Sikhism</link>, it is thought that due to the commendable past actions and deeds (known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/864/16864.xml">
karma</link> or kirat) that people obtain the chance of human birth, which is regarded in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/964/27964.xml">
Sikhism</link> as the highest possible opportunity on Earth and therefore should not be wasted. Only by continued good actions and the "Grace of the Almighty" can one obtain <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/385/936385.xml">
liberation</link> from the continuous cycle of births and deaths of various bodily forms that the soul has been undergoing since the creation of the universe. The end of the cycle of <link>
transmigration of the soul</link> is known as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/918/175918.xml">
mukti</link>. For Sikhs, the state of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/918/175918.xml">
mukti</link> can be achieved whilst still alive, known as "Jivan Mukat", literally "liberated whilst alive".</p>
