China</st>
<p>

Although generally known as <it>yóutiáo</it> in Standard Mandarin throughout China, the dish is also known as <it>guǒzi</it> (果子) in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/361/923361.xml">
northern China</link>. In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/045/198045.xml">
Min Nan</link>-speaking areas, it is known as  <it>iû-chiā-kóe</it> (油炸粿),<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref> where <it>kóe</it> (粿) means cake or pastry, hence "oil-fried cake/pastry". In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/533/147533.xml">
Cantonese</link>-speaking areas this is rendered as <it>yàuhjagwái</it> (油炸鬼), where <it>gwái</it> literally means "devil" or "ghost".<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></p>

<ss2>

Folk etymology</st>

<p>

The Cantonese name <it>yàuhjagwái</it> literally means "oil-fried devil" and, according to folklore, is an act of protest against <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/978/56978.xml">
Song Dynasty</link> official <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/239/9639239.xml">
Qin Hui</link>, who is said to have orchestrated the plot to frame the general <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/308/422308.xml">
Yue Fei</link>, an icon of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/552/24552.xml">
patriotism</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/154/156154.xml">
Chinese culture</link>. It is said that the food, originally in the shape of two human-shaped pieces of dough but later evolved into two pieces joined in the middle, represents Qin Hui and his wife, both having a hand in collaborating with the enemy to bring about the great general's demise. Thus the youtiao is deep fried and eaten as if done to the traitorous couple. In keeping with the legend, youtiao are often made as two foot-long rolls of dough joined along the middle, with one roll representing the husband and the other the wife.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/318/27318.xml">
Singapore</link> and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/937/3607937.xml">

Hokkien</link> (Minnan) name (油炸粿 <it>iû-chiā-kóe</it>).  It is rendered in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/630/126630.xml">
Malay</link> as <it>cakoi</it>, an alteration of the Minnan term, "char kway". The Malay version comes with various fillings, which are either sweet, such as red bean paste or savoury, such as sardines fried in tomato sauce. The plain version is usually eaten with coconut and egg jam <it><link>
kaya</link></it>. Cakoi is usually sold in morning street markets or "pasar malam" night markets.</p>

In the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/440/23440.xml">

Thailand </st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/128/30128.xml">
Thailand</link>, youtiao is generally called <it>pathongko</it> (, ) due to a confusion with a different kind of dessert. <it>Pathongko</it> is a Thai corruption of either <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/005/1095005.xml">
Teochew</link> <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/045/198045.xml">
Minnan</link> <it>beh teung guai</it> (白糖粿; Mandarin: <it>bái tángguǒ</it>) or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/292/1092292.xml">
Cantonese</link> of <it>baahktònggòu</it> (白糖糕; Mandarin: bái tánggāo). However, both possible original names are different desserts, not to be confused with the real <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/673/10470673.xml">
white sugar sponge cake (白糖糕)</link>. It was previously sold together with youtiao by <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/253/1497253.xml">
street vendors</link> who normally walked around and shouted both names out loud. However, Thai customers often mistakenly thought that the more popular youtiao was <it>"pathongko"</it>. Eventually, the real <it>pathongko</it> disappeared from the market because of its unpopularity. Ironically, the disappearance of real <it>"pathongko"</it> leaves youtiao being called under the former's name, but the latter's real name is generally unknown amongst the Thais.  But the original white sugar sponge cake can still be easily found in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/043/194043.xml">
Trang Province</link> in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/076/1453076.xml">
Southern Thailand</link> under its original name. Both Thailand and Cambodia are relatively neighbors to each other. So this is how they both have similar cuisines in ways.</p>
<p>

In Cambodia, it is also used for the cultural delicacies. It is used in rice porridge or noodle soup. The noodle soup is actually like Vietnamese pho. This fried delicacy is dipped into the noodle soup. Most of time this "you tiao" is dipped into the pho. In Thailand, pathongko is also dipped into condensed milk or, in the South, eaten with kaya.</p>

Vietnam</st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/546/32546.xml">
Vietnamese cuisine</link>, it is known by a name that is a mix of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/401/3618401.xml">
Sino-Vietnamese</link> and native Vietnamese to achieve a pronunciation similar to the Cantonese name, as <it>dầu cháo quỷ</it> or <it>giò cháo quẩy</it>. 油 ("Dầu/giò") 鬼 ("quỷ/quẩy") coming from Sino-Vietnamese (the differences between the two coming from differing dialects dating to before the standardization of Vietnamese) and "cháo" coming from the Vietnamese native word for <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/011/485011.xml">
congee</link>.</p>

Australia</link> it is sometimes called <b>chopstick cake</b> by some <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/430/5430.xml">
Cambodian</link> Chinese immigrants because of its resemblance to a pair of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/064/24346064.xml">
