Song debuted in the entertainment industry in 1996 when she won the Grand Prize in SunKyung Smart (a school uniform company) when she was finishing her third year in junior high school. It was not long until she starred in her first drama, <it>Merry Morning</it>. Since then, she would continue to star in a string of various dramas and sitcoms but it wasn't until the KBS drama <it>Autumn in My Heart</it> in 2000 with Song Seung-hun and Won Bin that she rose to fame throughout Asia. </p>

 Endorsements </st>
<p>

Song is one of the most in-demand product endorsers in Korea and has done many TV commercials and print ads over the years.

Personal life </st>
<p>

When Song was born, she was sick and her parents and doctor thought she would not survive. Miraculously she did and her parents only registered her birth on February 26, 1982 (instead of her actual birthdate). She has no siblings. Her hobbies are ice skating, swimming, and playing the piano.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2227%22])">27</ref></p>
<p>

Song has been in two highly publicized relationships. She started dating Lee Byung-hun while filming <it>All In</it> in 2003. Their relationship and subsequent break-up in 2004 generated much media attention and gossip. The experience taught her to draw a clear line between private and public life, saying in a 2008 Dong-A Ilbo interview, "The viewers suddenly learned, while in the midst of watching a drama I was acting in, that I was somebody’s girlfriend. In the end, this was an obstacle and only served to create a sense of dislike among viewers."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2228%22])">28</ref> In another interview for Fuji TV, Song was asked about her first love and fans speculated that she was obliquely referring to Lee.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2229%22])">29</ref></p>
<p>

Song kept in touch with Hyun Bin after <it>The World That They Live In</it> ended, but it was their separation while Hyun was filming <it>Friend, Our Legend</it> in Busan that made them realize they were in love. They announced their dating status in June 2009.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2230%22])">30</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2231%22])">31</ref> In March 2011 mere hours after Hyun's military enlistment, his and Song's agencies confirmed speculation that the couple had broken up. According to the joint press release, "Both have been very busy shooting films and dramas both in and out of Korea, which inevitably caused them to grow apart." With rumors of their separation circulating since late 2010, the agencies said the two split up in early 2011 but wanted to keep it secret for the time being "because neither of them wanted the public attention to be directed on their split instead of their professional work. Hyun also did not want a personal issue to interfere with his last days with his fans before starting his military service."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2232%22])">32</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2233%22])">33</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2234%22])">34</ref></p>
<p>

Asked about the aftereffects of her two romantic relationships that caught the public's attention, Song said in October 2011, "I think the time when I felt uncomfortable about living under a microscope has gone. I'm no longer afraid of such things. What I did was typical of any woman my age. In fact, I haven't had any time to feel lonely."<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref></p>
