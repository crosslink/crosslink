<b>Cellophane noodles</b> (also known as <b>Chinese vermicelli</b>, <b>bean threads</b>, <b>bean thread noodles</b>, <b>crystal noodles</b>, or <b>glass noodles</b>) are a type of transparent <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/267/90267.xml">
noodle</link> made from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/711/27711.xml">
starch</link> (such as <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/839/465839.xml">
mung bean</link> starch, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/275/3152275.xml">
yam</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/998/23926998.xml">
potato starch</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/465/56465.xml">
cassava</link> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/316/65316.xml">
canna starch</link>), and water.<p>

They are generally sold in dried form, boiled to reconstitute, then used in soups, stir fried dishes, or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/529/1139529.xml">
spring roll</link>s.  They are called "cellophane noodles" or "glass noodles" because of their appearance when cooked, resembling <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/015/162015.xml">
cellophane</link>, a clear material or a translucent light gray or brownish-gray color.</p>
<p>

Cellophane noodles are generally round, and are available in various thicknesses. Wide, flat cellophane noodle sheets called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/567/13187567.xml">
mung bean sheet</link>s are also produced in China.</p>
<p>

Cellophane noodles should not be confused with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/924/3254924.xml">
rice vermicelli</link>, which are made from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/979/36979.xml">
rice</link> and are white in color rather than clear (after cooking in water).</p>

Chinese</link>, the most commonly used names are:

<it>fěn sī</it> (): with <it>fěn</it> meaning "powder" and <it>sī</it> meaning "thread"</entry>

<p>

They are also marketed under the name <b>saifun</b>, the <link>
Cantonese</link> pronunciation of the Mandarin <it>xì fěn</it> (; literally "slender powder"), though the name <it>fan2 si1</it> (粉絲) is the term most often used in Cantonese. While by itself the character <it>fěn</it> () means powder, it etymology is probably related to <it>diàn fěn</it> (), which means "starch"the substance from which the noodles are made.</p>

Production</st>
<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/405/5405.xml">
China</link>, the primary site of production of cellophane noodles is the town of Zhangxing, in the city of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/911/8449911.xml">
Zhaoyuan</link> (), which is administered by the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/703/368703.xml">
prefecture-level city</link> of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/441/261441.xml">
Yantai</link>, in the eastern province of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/032/105032.xml">
Shandong</link>. However, historically, the noodles were shipped through the port of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/642/3658642.xml">
Longkou</link> (which is also under the administration of Yantai), and thus the noodles are known and marketed as Longkou <it>fensi</it> ().<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref></p>

In China, cellophane noodles are usually made of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/839/465839.xml">
mung bean</link> starch and are a popular ingredient used in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/000/53000.xml">
stir fries</link>, soups, and particularly <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/950/1379950.xml">
hot pot</link>s. They can also be used as an ingredient in fillings for a variety of Chinese <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/644/11880644.xml">
jiaozi</link></it> (dumplings) and <it><link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/115/6740115.xml">
bing</link></it> (<link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/459/2493459.xml">
flatbreads</link>), especially in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/591/32591.xml">
vegetarian</link> versions of these dishes. Thicker cellophane noodles are also commonly used to imitate the appearance and texture of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/354/879354.xml">
shark's fin</link> in vegetarian soups. Thicker varieties, most popular in China's <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/662/788662.xml">
northeast</link>, are used in stir fries as well as cold salad-like dishes. A popular soup using the ingredient is fried tofu with thin noodles (; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/588/23588.xml">
Pinyin</link>: <it>yóu dòu fu-xiàn fěn tāng</it>). A popular <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/908/27908.xml">
Sichuan</link> dish called <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/678/2349678.xml">
ants climbing a tree</link> (; <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/588/23588.xml">

Health concerns</st>
<p>

In 2004, testing by Chinese authorities determined that some brands of cellophane noodles produced in <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/441/261441.xml">
Yantai</link>, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/032/105032.xml">
Shandong</link> were contaminated with <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/747/17747.xml">
lead</link>.  It emerged that several unscrupulous companies were making their noodles from <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/540/473540.xml">
cornstarch</link> instead of mung beans in order to save costs, and, to make the cornstarch transparent, were adding lead-based whiteners to their noodles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> In December 2006, Beijing authorities again inspected cellophane noodles produced by the Yantai Deshengda Longkou Vermicelli Co. Ltd. in Siduitou village, Zhangxing town, <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/911/8449911.xml">
Zhaoyuan</link> city, Yantai, this time determining that <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/031/4932031.xml">
sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate</link>, a toxic and possibly carcinogenic industrial <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/937/12873937.xml">
bleach</link> that is an illegal food additive in China, had been used in the production of the noodles.  The company, which formerly sold its noodles both in China as well as overseas, was ordered to cease production and distribution.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></p>
<p>

In December 2010, Czech food inspection authorities (SZPI) again inspected Chinese cellophane noodles, this time determining that 142.00 mg/kg of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/904/904.xml">
aluminium</link>, which is an illegal amount for food in Czech (and EU) market, had been used in the production of the noodles.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%227%22])">7</ref></p>

In <link>
Philippine cuisine</link>, the noodles are called a similar name: <it>sotanghon</it> because of the popular dish of the same name made from them using chicken and <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/675/3543675.xml">

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/976/15976.xml">

<p>

In <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/270/13270.xml">
Hawaii</link>, where cuisine is heavily influenced by Asian cultures, cellophane noodles are known locally as <b>long rice</b>, supposedly because the process of making the noodles involves extruding the starch through a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../../pages/574/1970574.xml">
