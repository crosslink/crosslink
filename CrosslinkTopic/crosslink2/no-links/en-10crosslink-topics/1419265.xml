<b>x264</b> is a free software library for encoding  video streams into the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC format.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>  It is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%221%22])">1</ref>

History</st>
<p>

x264 was originally developed by Laurent Aimar, who stopped development in 2004 after being hired by ATEME, Loren Merritt then took over development. Today, x264 is primarily developed by Loren Merritt, Jason Garrett-Glaser, Steven Walters, Anton Mitrofanov, Henrik Gramner and Daniel Kang.</p>

Capabilities</st>
<p>

x264 provides a command line interface as well as an API.  The former is used by many graphical user interfaces, such as Staxrip and MeGUI.  The latter is used by many other interfaces, such as HandBrake<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%222%22])">2</ref> and FFmpeg<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%223%22])">3</ref></p>
<p>

As of August 2008, x264 implements more features than any other H.264 encoder.

x264 has some notable psychovisual enhancements which help to increase the visual quality.
<list>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Adaptive quantisation in two modes using VAQ.  The second mode, a later addition, adapts the strength per frame in an attempt to improve the quality.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%224%22])">4</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Psychovisual Rateâ€“distortion optimization which attempts to maintain a similar complexity.  The complexity is measured using a combination of SSD and SATD.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%225%22])">5</ref></entry>
<entry level="1" type="bullet">

 Macroblock-tree rate control which controls the quality by tracking how often parts of the frame are used for predicting future frames.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%226%22])">6</ref></entry>
</list>

x264 has won awards in the following codec comparisons:

</list>
</p>
<p>

x264 has SIMD assembly code acceleration on x86, PowerPC (using AltiVec), and ARMv7 (using NEON) platforms.</p>
<p>

In April 2010, the x264 project announced full Blu-ray compliant video encoding capability making x264 the first free Blu-ray compliant software H.264 encoder.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2212%22])">12</ref>  x264 has always had the ability to create video streams that are playable on most Blu-ray devices; however, it was up to the user to choose appropriate conversion settings.  The default x264 preset chooses adequate compatibility for Blu-ray players; however, it is now possible to choose more complex conversion settings while simply maintaining compatibility by explicitly enabling Blu-ray compatibility mode.  Blu-ray compatibility can be useful when striving for cross device compatibility (especially in the realm of high definition hardware media players).</p>

Warner Brothers has used x264 for commercial Blu-rays.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2213%22])">13</ref></p>

Tandberg controversy</st>
<p>

In November 2010, Jason Garret-Glaser, an x264 developer, published information in which he claims that one of Tandberg Telecom's (a Cisco Systems subsidiary) patent applications from December 2008 contains a step-by-step description of an algorithm he committed to the x264 codebase around two months earlier.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2214%22])">14</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2215%22])">15</ref> This was relayed by media, which remarked that the company who filed the patent was following the x264 project IRC development channel and was known to the project developers,<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2216%22])">16</ref><ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2217%22])">17</ref> leading to Tandberg claiming that they discovered the algorithm independently.<ref xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="#xpointer(//reflist/entry[@id=%2218%22])">18</ref></p>
